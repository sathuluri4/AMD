1.       Application to generate an RSA key pair, key size = 2048 bits (Standard Java library can be used to generate all keys and hashes).

2.       Application to generate SHA-256 hash of the attached file. No signing is needed. Just print hash in HEX encoding to standard output.

3.       Application that will encrypt and decrypt the file using the RSA key pair generated.
